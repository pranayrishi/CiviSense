# CiviSense – Your AI Legal Translator

CiviSense is an AI-powered legal translator designed to simplify complex legal language for everyone—especially underserved communities without access to legal counsel.

## 💡 Inspiration

Legal jargon is often a barrier to justice. Millions of individuals face legal proceedings without fully understanding what’s being said in court or written in documents. We created CiviSense to change that—by using AI to make legal language human.

## 🛠️ What It Does

- Transcribes courtroom audio into text using advanced speech-to-text models.
- Translates legal documents and transcripts into plain English.
- Outputs readable, concise explanations of legal terms, rulings, and clauses.
- Helps users understand their legal rights and court outcomes without needing a lawyer.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Speech Recognition:** Uses Whisper or other ASR APIs to transcribe court audio recordings.
2. **Legal NLP Translation:** A GPT-4-based model trained on legal datasets transforms legal text into understandable summaries.
3. **Output Layer:** Presents simplified summaries alongside original documents for transparency.
4. **Frontend:** A lightweight web UI allows users to upload files or paste text/audio for translation.
